## Exercise 2: Price Calculator for a local grocery store

### Setup
The calculator was programmed using Ruby version 2.6.3 and makes use of gem Bigdecimal version 3.0.2 to handle currency.

Run controller/price_calculator.rb in your terminal
```bash
ruby controller/price_calculator.rb
```
The only working items for the prompt are below as the price table is static.

1. milk
2. bread
3. banana
4. apple

The program assumes that all entered items are valid and only checks to correct for whitespace and letter casing.
